The first few lines are loading the audio file and then runing the discrete cosine transform.

The next steps to sort the result were not followed. I did not find them necessary to follow. Instead, a threshold was determined and tested to find at what threshold the resulting reconstruction would give a .1\% rate.

The number of coefficients removed due to the thresheold is 321. The remaining coefficients are 4578, or 93.45\%.

The resulting plots are as following. The image is when the amount of energy is 99.9\%.

As evident in the image, there is a visibly exact match between the original and the reconstructed image. The other thresholds that were tested before have a visible difference and a signficiant difference.
